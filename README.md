**Student Performance Tracker:**
This Python-based system efficiently manages and tracks student grades using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. The program calculates individual and class averages, determines whether students pass, and provides detailed performance feedback.

**How to Use:**
Clone the repository to your local machine or open the .ipynb file in Jupyter or Google Colab.
Add student names and scores for subjects like Math, Science, and English.
The program processes the data to calculate averages, class performance, and individual pass/fail statuses.
**Files:**
student_performance_tracker.ipynb: Jupyter/Colab notebook for running the project interactively.
student_performance_tracker.py: Python script for executing the program on the command line.
**Requirements:**

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook (optional for .ipynb files)
Google Colab (optional for cloud-based execution)

**Installation:**
Clone the repository using:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/Student_Performance_Tracker.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Student_Performance_Tracker
To run:
Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter or Colab.
Execute the student_performance_tracker.py script directly using:
bash
Copy code
python student_performance_tracker.py

**Features:**

Add Students: Record names and grades for multiple subjects.
Performance Calculation: Compute individual averages and assess pass/fail status.
Class Statistics: Calculate the overall class average.
Error Handling: Detect invalid inputs, handle missing data, and ensure smooth execution.
